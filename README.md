# AI Collaboration Framework

This project is an experiment in building a new paradigm for human-AI partnership in the creative space. It's designed not as a tool that replaces a designer, but as a framework that augments their abilities.

## Core Philosophy

Our system is built on a set of guiding principles defined in our foundational `collaboration-framework.md`. The core idea is to create a true collaborator that can handle repetitive work, provide structured creativity, and learn from user interaction, all while keeping the human as the ultimate creative director.

## How It Works

The framework is architected like a modern, extensible development tool (e.g., NeoVim):

- **A Core Engine:** Manages project state, file operations, and command dispatching.
- **Extensible Plugins:** The `.windsurf/rules/` directory contains self-contained "plugins" that define specific workflows and capabilities.

This allows for a highly configurable, maintainable, and scalable system where new functionalities can be added without altering the core.

## Current Status

We are in the initial development phase, establishing the core architecture and foundational files.

**Branch:** `v1`
