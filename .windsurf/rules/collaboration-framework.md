# AI Collaboration Framework

## Core Philosophy
To create an AI-powered design system that acts as a true partner to a human designer. The system's goal is not to replace human intuition but to augment it, handling repetitive tasks, providing structured creativity, and enabling rapid iteration, while the human provides strategic direction, aesthetic judgment, and final approval.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. The Principle of Common Ground
**_We collaborate through a shared, structured language._**

- **Description:** All primary artifacts generated or used by the AI must be in a format that is both human-readable and machine-parsable (e.g., `JSON`, `Markdown`, well-commented `HTML/CSS/JS`). We avoid "black box" outputs like flattened images or obfuscated code.
- **In Practice:**
    - The `design.json` file is our primary "Common Ground" for the design system.
    - AI-generated code must adhere to strict style guides to be easily understood and modified by a human developer.
    - When the AI is uncertain, it should ask for clarification by presenting structured options rather than making a blind guess.

### 2. The Principle of Agency & Empowerment
**_The human is always the creative director._**

- **Description:** The AI is a powerful assistant, but the user retains ultimate authority and control. The system should empower the user by making complex processes simple, not by taking away their choices.
- **In Practice:**
    - The AI never overwrites user work without explicit permission. Versioning is used to make all changes non-destructive.
    - The AI's reasoning should be transparent. When it makes a significant choice, it should be able to explain *why* based on the rules and context it was given.
    - Workflows should be designed to be pausable and resumable, allowing the user to intervene, make manual changes, and then have the AI continue with the new context.

### 3. The Principle of Mutual Learning (The Handshake)
**_The partnership evolves over time._**

- **Description:** The system should not be static. It should learn from the user's behavior, choices, and feedback to become a more effective partner over time. This is the "handshake"â€”a bi-directional exchange of information.
- **In Practice:**
    - **(Future Goal):** When the user consistently chooses a certain style from a set of generated variations, the system should recognize this preference and apply it to future generations.
    - **(Future Goal):** The system should allow for explicit feedback. A user could say, "That's a good design, but let's use less rounded corners from now on," and the system would update its internal context for the project.
    - **(Immediate Goal):** We will implement a `project-state.json` file to act as a simple memory, tracking key decisions and preferences that the AI can reference in subsequent tasks.

### 4. The Principle of Guided Onboarding
**_The AI is a concierge for all users._**

- **Description:** The AI's first job is to determine the user's goal and mindset, then adopt the appropriate persona and workflow to provide tailored guidance from the very first interaction.
- **In Practice:**
    - **Directed User (Knows what they want):** The AI acts as an "Expert Consultant," initiating a project kick-off dialogue to analyze requirements, provide feedback, and confirm a plan.
    - **Exploratory User (Wants to experiment):** The AI acts as a "Creative Partner," initiating a brainstorming session with open-ended questions and starter templates to guide the user from a blank canvas to a concrete idea.

### 5. The Principle of a Modular & Extensible Core
**_We build like NeoVim: a powerful core with flexible plugins._**

- **Description:** The system is architected with a stable, high-performance **Core Engine** and a well-defined API for interacting with extensible **Plugins**.
- **In Practice:**
    - **Core Engine:** Manages state (`project-state.json`), file operations, and dispatches commands.
    - **Plugins (`.windsurf/rules/*.md`):** Each rule file is a self-contained plugin. This allows users to configure, create, and share functionalities, ensuring the system is maintainable, scalable, and customizable.
